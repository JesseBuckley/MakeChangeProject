# Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclispe
-Google (extensively)
# Lessons Learned
 -I have somewhat learned when to use % statements.
-Reiterated my understanding of casting data types a bit.
-I have a very weak understanding of the "Math." function so I spent many hours trying to find a way to round up the numbers before I just started Googling. To come to find that Math.round saves lives.
