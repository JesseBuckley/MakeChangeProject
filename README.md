# MakeChangeProject

# How to Run
1. Run in terminal.
You'll be prompted to enter the price of your item.

2. Enter the price into terminal.
You'll then be prompted to give the cashier an amount of money to pay for the item you selected.

3. Which then returns how much money you gave the cashier, how much total your change is. And then your change based on type from highest to lowest.

# Project Description
Make Change Project is a program that acts like a cash register. 
You bring a item to the register, you produce money to pay for said item.
If you only have larger bills that is fine too. The register has plenty of change.
# Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclispe
-Google (extensively)
# Lessons Learned
-I am completely new to coding and I need lots of practice on all these newly learned features and functions.
-I was defintely a little shaky on my grasp of (if, and if else statements). I feel much more confident with them after this project.
 -I have somewhat learned when to use % statements.
-Reiterated my understanding of casting data types a bit.
-I have a very weak understanding of the "Math." function so I spent many hours trying to find a way to round up the numbers before I just started Googling. To come to find that Math.round times 100 would round my double number to a whole one. Which made the logic of getting each coin and bill alot easier for me to grasp. 
-I know the homework did not specify to do this. But I learned to make each possible output have the logic to know when to use a comma or period. 
- I decided to try and throw the logic that calculates change into its own method. I got that to work which was great. Makes my code look much less messy.
